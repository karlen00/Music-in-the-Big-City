## Project Description

This project aims to analyze and compare the music preferences of listeners in two cities, Springfield and Shelbyville, using data from Y.Music. In this analysis, we will test several hypotheses related to differences in music preferences based on the day of the week, time of day, and the listener's city of residence.

## Hypotheses

1. **User activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city.**
2. **On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday nights.**
3. **Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different music preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.**

## Data Description

The data used in this project is stored in the file `music_project_en.csv`. This file contains information about the songs played by users in both cities. Below is the description of the columns in the dataset:

- `userID`: User ID
- `Track`: Song title
- `artist`: Artist name
- `genre`: Music genre
- `City`: User's city of residence
- `time`: Time the song was played
- `Day`: Day of the week

1. **Data Collection**: Downloading and loading the `music_project_en.csv` dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checking and cleaning the data for errors or missing values.
3. **Data Exploration**: Performing descriptive analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Using statistical methods to test the formulated hypotheses.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to support analysis and interpretation of results.
6. **Reporting Results**: Compiling a final report that includes the main findings and conclusions from the analysis.
