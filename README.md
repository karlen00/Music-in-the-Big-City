# Music-in-the-Big-City
This project aims to analyze and compare the music preferences of listeners in two cities, Springfield and Shelbyville, using data from Y.Music. In this analysis, we will test several hypotheses related to differences in music preferences based on the day of the week, time of day, and the listener's city of residence.
